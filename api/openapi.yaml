    We publish everything related to our API on github at this location: <a href="https://github.com/eZmaxinc" target="_blank">https://github.com/eZmaxinc</a>. You'll find git repos for the specification, documentation, SDKs and samples.

    Documentation, SDKs and samples are provided in english only for easier maintenance, but we also have french speaking integrators that can help you out.

    Most of our SDKs provide language specific documentation, but you'll find more details on this page about the general use of the API. Both the SDK's specific document (if you choose to use a SDK) and this documentation can be used in complementarity.

    If you find any mistake or omission in the documentation, please notify us. We'll quickly fix the issue.

    ## Onboarding
    We highly recommend to schedule an online meeting with your technical team and an eZmax integrator. During this meeting, we go through requirements, business logic, configuration, api key generation, and we go through the list of functions you might need to implement to achieve your goals. Make sure you take this opportunity to speed up your integration project.

    If you need help understanding how to use this API, don't waste too much time searching in it. Contact support-api@ezmax.ca, we're here to help. We are developpers so we know programmers don't like to waste time in documentation. If you don't find what you need in the documentation, let us know, we'll improve it and put you rapidly up on track.

    ## Open API
    We highly believe in open standards and open source. We have adopted the Open API vision where all of the functionnalities of our applications are accessible with open source definition files. We use our own public API's to build our interfaces so you can do pretty much everything we can do. Open API has a rich toolset from editor, generators, mock servers, validators, etc. Learn more at <a href="https://www.openapis.org/" target="_blank">OpenAPI Initiative</a>

    If you need  our Open API Spec file to use in your toolset, here is a direct link to it: <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eZmaxinc/eZmax-API/master/specs/ezmax.v1.1.json" target="_blank">ezmax.v1.1.json</a>

    ## SDK
    We provide SDKs for customers. They are generated using <a href="https://openapi-generator.tech/" target="_blank">OpenAPI Generator</a>, we encourage customers to use them as we also provide samples for them. You can choose to build your own implementation manually or can use any compatible OpenAPI 3.0 generator like <a href="https://openapi-generator.tech/" target="_blank">OpenAPI Generator</a>, <a href="https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-codegen/" target="_blank">Swagger Codegen</a> or any commercial generators.

    We try to make it as easy as possible for you to use our SDKs so we publish packages on NPM and Composer. If you don't find your favorite language supported or it we could make your like easier by automating package distribution, let us know !

  x-displayName: Introduction
- description: "## Authorization\n\nExcept for a few functions that do not require\
    \ authorization, most of the functions require an API key that is sent in the\
    \ request headers. The header name is \"Authorization\". \n\nThere are 4 types\
    \ of API Key that can be used to make requests to the API.\n\n1. **API type key**\
    \ which is static and not session based. It can be generated from the admin console.\
    \ This is the most common type of authentication for \"server to server\" kind\
    \ of integration. Never use this in a web based (client) application as the key\
    \ could be leaked. This type of key begins with the letter **A**.\n\n2. **Delegated\
    \ type key** which has an expiration time. It is commonly used in mobile or web\
    \ application where you cannot use an **API type key** that could be leaked. The\
    \ application would query a server part that will generate a **Delegated type\
    \ key** using an **API type key**. The **Delegated type key** could now be used\
    \ by the mobile or web page application without leaking the **API type key**.\
    \ This type of key begins with the letter **D**.\n\n3. **User type key** which\
    \ are session based and can be retrieved after a successful authentication. This\
    \ type of key is reserved to specific situations where the other types of key\
    \ are not desirable. This type of key begins with the letter **U**.\n\n4. **Special\
    \ type key** which are for special cases where other types of keys cannot be used.\
    \ This type of key is reserved to specific situations. This type of key begins\
    \ with the letter **S**.\n\n## IP restriction\n\nEach API key can be restricted\
    \ to specific IP addresse(s). This is an optional but recommended security feature\
    \ you should put in place if all your requests will be coming from a specific\
    \ range. You can configure the allowed ranges from the eZmax administration console.\n\
    \n## Permissions\n\nEach API Key can be configured to have specific permission(s)\
    \ so we highly recommend to use the \"Least privileges\" principle. For example,\
    \ instead of allowing all permissions to an API Key, you should perhaps create\
    \ an API Keys each for each of your application having just the specific permissions\
    \ needed. You can configure the API Key's permission in eZmax's administration\
    \ console.\n\n## Request Signing\n\nRequest Signing is a process of signing the\
    \ request with a **Secret** that is not transmitted over the Wire. The signing\
    \ process improves security in case your API Key is leaked or during a MITM attack\
    \ (Man in the Middle). It will also prevent request manipulation or replay attack.\
    \ Since all requests must use **https** these kinds of attacks are hard to conduct\
    \ but sometimes customers might not be aware their underlying library does not\
    \ verify SSL Certs validity or that their application can disclose their API key\
    \ if it's not well secured. It takes a bit of effort to sign requests but it's\
    \ highly recommended to do so.\n\nMandatory requirements of signing varies by\
    \ used key type. For **API** type keys (most common type), you can configure if\
    \ signing is mandatory or not in eZmax's administration console. **Delegated**,\
    \ **User** and **Special** type keys must sign requests otherwise requests will\
    \ fail.\n\n### How to sign a request\n\nTo apply a signature to your request you\
    \ will need to send 3 additional HTTP Headers to the request:\n- Ezmax-Date\n\
    - Ezmax-Fingerprint\n- Ezmax-Signature\n\n### Ezmax-Date\n\n**Ezmax-Date** Is\
    \ the date/time when you send the request. It needs to be a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601\"\
    \ target=\"_blank\">ISO 8601</a> formatted date/time. It's a format that supports\
    \ timezones so you can either use your local timezone of GMT. Be aware certain\
    \ implementation adds milliseconds to the formatted date which won't be accepted\
    \ by the API (ex: Javascript's toISOString function).\n\nThere is a tolerance\
    \ of ±5 minutes clock skew between the date/time you specify and the server's\
    \ time so make sure your time is correct. Usage of a NTP server is recommended.\
    \ Compute the date/time as close as possible to the actual sending of the request.\
    \ For example, don't set the current time at the beginning of a long running script\
    \ that sends 50 requests to the server with the same time/date as you might receive\
    \ errors related to clock skew.\n\nExamples:\n- 2000-12-31T23:59:59Z\n- 2000-12-31T23:59:59-05:00\n\
    \n### Ezmax-Fingerprint\n\n**Ezmax-Fingerprint** Is a fingerprint (aka hash) representing\
    \ the request you are sending. Any alteration in any part of the request would\
    \ produce a different fingerprint. The hash is computed using <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2\"\
    \ target=\"_blank\">SHA256</a>. Most programming languages offer an implementation\
    \ of SHA256. To make sure your implementation is producing expected values, try\
    \ to hash the value \"foo\", it should produce the value \"2c26b46b68ffc68ff99b453c1d30413413422d706483bfa0f98a5e886266e7ae\"\
    .\n\nTo compute the Fingerprint, you'll need to concatenate the **Method**, the\
    \ **URL**, the **Body**, the **API Key** and the **Date**. All these values will\
    \ need to be separated by a line Feed caracter (\\n). Make sure your **Method**\
    \ is Uppercase (Shoud be \"GET\", not \"Get\" or \"get\"). Make sure your URL\
    \ Scheme and Host or the **URL** are lowercase (Should be \"https://www.example.com\"\
    , not \"HTTPS://WWW.EXAMPLE.COM\"). Also make sure the the URI part of the **URL**\
    \ is properly URL encoded (Should be \"/Path%20with%20Spaces/?Key=Value%20with%20Spaces\"\
    , not \"/Path with Spaces/?Key=Value with Spaces\". If the **Body** is empty (ex:\
    \ GET request don't have a body), use an empty string.\n\nOnce the SHA256 hash\
    \ is computed, prefix it with \"v1=\" which is future proofing version identifier.\n\
    \nHere is an example implementation in PHP:\n\n    public static function getFingerprintV1\
    \ ($sAuthorization, $dtDate, $sMethod, $sURL, $sBody = '') {\n        $sContentToHash\
    \ = \"$sMethod\\n$sURL\\n$sBody\\n$sAuthorization\\n$dtDate\";\n        return\
    \ 'v1='.hash('sha256', $sContentToHash);\n    }\n\nHere are two examples of what\
    \ a GET and POST requests Fingerprints could look like. You can validate if your\
    \ algorithm work by using these sample values and comparing them to the expected\
    \ values. In the example below the litteral \"\\n\" should be replaced with a\
    \ linefeed character.\n\n    GET\\n\n    https://prod.api.appcluster01.ca-central-1.ezmax.com/rest/1/object/activesession/getCurrent\\\
    n\n    \\n\n    ThisIsMyAuthorizationKey\\n\n    2000-12-31T23:59:59Z\nExpected\
    \ result for **Ezmax-Fingerprint** (GET): v1=8f6f3ed75edb6e2cbe777b4fda5cab1a6adaebadc758780eb82c3d49934f354a\n\
    \n    POST\\n\n    https://prod.api.global.ezmax.com/1/module/sspr/sendUsernames\\\
    n\n    {\"pksCustomerCode\": \"demo\",\"fkiLanguageID\": \"2\",\"eUserTypeSSPR\"\
    : \"Native\",\"sEmailAddress\": \"example@domain.com\"}\\n\n    ThisIsMyAuthorizationKey\\\
    n\n    2000-12-31T23:59:59Z\nExpected result for **Ezmax-Fingerprint** (POST):\
    \ v1=6dbdbc26437f1216f9cd0068a4fc35c272a062b1f638c7557d497ebbf3702ded\n\n### Ezmax-Signature\n\
    \n**Ezmax-Signature** Is the actual signature proving the request was generated\
    \ by the key owner using its secret. The signature is computed using <a href=\"\
    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMAC\" target=\"_blank\">HMAC</a> and <a href=\"\
    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2\" target=\"_blank\">SHA256</a>. Don't confuse\
    \ **SHA256 (aka SHA2-256)** and **SHA3-256**, these are 2 distinct algorithms.\
    \ Most programming languages offer an implementation of HMAC with SHA256. To make\
    \ sure your implementation is producing expected values, try to hash the value\
    \ \"foo\" with the key \"bar\", it should produce the value \"147933218aaabc0b8b10a2b3a5c34684c8d94341bcf10a4736dc7270f7741851\"\
    .\n\nTo compute the Signature, you'll need to concatenate the **Ezmax-Fingerprint**,\
    \ the **API Key** and the **Ezmax-Date**. The 3 values are concatenated WITHOUT\
    \ separators. Then calculate the HMAC using SHA256 using your **Secret** as the\
    \ key.\n\nOnce the HMAC-SHA256 hash is computed, prefix it with \"v1=\" which\
    \ is future proofing version identifier.\n\nHere is an example implementation\
    \ in PHP:\n\n    public static function getSignatureV1 ($sAuthorization, $dtDate,\
    \ $sFingerprint, $sSecret) {\n        $sContentToSign = \"$sFingerprint$sAuthorization$dtDate\"\
    ;\n        return 'v1='.hash_hmac('sha256', $sContentToSign, $sSecret);\n    }\n\
    \nHere are two examples of what the GET and POST requests Signature would be.\
    \ You can validate if your algorithm work by using these sample values and comparing\
    \ them to the expected values. For the below examples, we have used the same **API\
    \ Key**, **Fingerprint** and **Date** as in the Fingerprint section above. The\
    \ only new variable is the **Secret** which is \"ThisIsTheSecretAssociatedToTheAuthorizationKey\"\
    \ for this example.\n\n    v1=8f6f3ed75edb6e2cbe777b4fda5cab1a6adaebadc758780eb82c3d49934f354aThisIsMyAuthorizationKey2000-12-31T23:59:59Z\n\
    Expected result for **Ezmax-Signature** (GET): v1=3a95fde64d27527745bcb0dd91be8caf7917c6778197e22d1d56c87245f979f5\n\
    \n    v1=6dbdbc26437f1216f9cd0068a4fc35c272a062b1f638c7557d497ebbf3702dedThisIsMyAuthorizationKey2000-12-31T23:59:59Z\n\
    Expected result for **Ezmax-Signature** (POST): v1=71e05f01eaab704ec76a078a9a5c49abe9d5a490786e43b86156d281acda7cba\n\
    \n### Wrapping up the examples\n\nThe whole process was detailed above but here\
    \ is summary of what your http headers should look like to sign these example\
    \ requests considering the following common variables:\n\n| Variable      | Example\
    \ value                                  |\n| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------\
    \ |\n| Date          | 2000-12-31T23:59:59Z                           |\n| Authorization\
    \ | ThisIsMyAuthorizationKey                       |\n| Secret        | ThisIsTheSecretAssociatedToTheAuthorizationKey\
    \ |\n\nFor a GET request to https://prod.api.appcluster01.ca-central-1.ezmax.com/rest/1/object/activesession/getCurrent:\n\

    \n## Range operator\n\nDates in list filter can use a \"rg\" operator for ranges.\
    \ This allows to filter data based on relative dates. The range operator is just\
    \ another way to compute filters dates.\n\nFor the rest of this section, let's\
    \ assume today's date is February 25th 2019 and the time is 10:15:37. Let's assume\
    \ that we want to filter on dtInvoiceDate.\n\nIf we wanted to get all the invoices\
    \ that were generated in the previous month, we could do (not url encoded for\
    \ readability purposes):\nsFilter=dtInvoiceDate gte '2019-01-01 00:00:00' and\
    \ dtInvoiceDate lte '2019-01-31 23:59:59'\n\nRange operator is useful to transfer\
    \ the complexity of date computation to the api instead of the calling application.\n\
    \nThe general format of the range operator is:\ndtInvoiceDate rg '**[STARTDATE]**,**[ENDDATE]**'\n\
    \nBoth **[STARTDATE]** and **[ENDDATE]** use the same format which is a sequence\
    \ of 1 or more **[SUBSECTION]** so for example, we could have:\ndtInvoiceDate\
    \ rg '**[SUBSECTION]**,**[SUBSECTION][SUBSECTION][SUBSECTION][SUBSECTION]**'\n\
    \nBoth **[STARTDATE]** and **[ENDDATE]** have a starting time equal to current\
    \ time (so in this example 2019-02-25 10:15:37)\n\n**[SUBSECTION]** start with\
    \ an operator which can be either **=** to reset the pointer, **+** to move forward\
    \ in time or **-** to move backward in time. \n\nThe **=** operator can be directly\
    \ followed by a letter representing the **[PERIOD]** (ex: **=m**) to initialize\
    \ the date to the start or end of the period or by a number and a letter representing\
    \ the **[PERIOD]** (ex: **=7m**) to set the **[PERIOD]** to a specific value.\n\
    \nThe **+** and **-** operators are followed by a number then by a letter representing\
    \ the **[PERIOD]** (ex: **+7d** or **-1m**)\n\nHere is a list of valid **[PERIOD]**\n\
    \n| [Period] | Description |\n|---|---|\n| y | year |\n| m | month |\n| w | week\
    \ |\n| d | day |\n| h | hour |\n| i | minute |\n| s | second |\n\n**=** operator\
    \ without a number resets the pointer to either the beginning or the end of the\
    \ **[Period]** depending if it's being used in the **[STARTDATE]** or **[ENDDATE]**.\
    \ This table shows the time when the pointer is reset\n\n| Syntax | Description\
    \ | [STARTDATE] | [ENDDATE] |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| =y | year | 2019-01-01 00:00:00\
    \ | 2019-12-31 23:59:59 |\n| =m | month | 2019-02-01 00:00:00 | 2019-02-28 23:59:59\
    \ |\n| =w | week\\* | 2019-02-24 00:00:00 | 2019-03-02 23:59:59 |\n| =d | day\
    \ | 2019-02-25 00:00:00 | 2019-02-25 23:59:59 |\n| =h | hour | 2019-02-25 10:00:00\
    \ | 2019-02-25 10:59:59 |\n| =i | minute | 2019-02-25 10:15:00 | 2019-02-25 10:15:59\
    \ |\n| =s | second | 2019-02-25 10:15:37 | 2019-02-25 10:15:37 |\n\n\\* Week start\
    \ day is configurable per user\n\n**=** operator with a number resets the **[PERIOD]**\
    \ to a specific value and works the same for both **[STARTDATE]** or **[ENDDATE]**.\
    \ Here are some example. Please note it's not possible to reset the week like\
    \ this (ex: **=7w**)\n\n| Syntax | Description | New Date |\n|---|---|---|\n|\
    \ =2025y | year | **2025**-02-25 10:15:37 |\n| =11m | month | 2019-**11**-25 10:15:37\
    \ |\n| =7d | day | 2019-02-**07** 10:15:37 |\n| =17h | hour | 2019-02-25 **17**:15:37\
    \ |\n| =1i | minute | 2019-02-25 10:**01**:37 |\n| =18s | second | 2019-02-25\
    \ 10:15:**18** |\n\n### Combining [SUBSECTION]\n\nYou can combine multiple [SUBSECTION]\
    \ under the same operator. For example:\n- Instead of using \"=m=7d=8h=6m=32s\"\
    \ you can simplify as \"=m7d8h6m32s\"\n- Instead of using \"+7d+7h+7m+7s\" you\
    \ can simplify as \"+7d7h7m7s\"\n- Instead of using \"=3m=m\" you can simplify\
    \ as \"=3mm\"\n\n### Order of precedence\n\n**[STARTDATE]** and **[ENDDATE]**\
    \ are evaluated from left to right. The order is important. For example, these\
    \ values would give different results in **[ENDDATE]**:\n- \"=m-1m\" would give\
    \ \"2019-01-28 23:59:59\"\n- \"-1m=m\" would give \"2019-01-31 23:59:59\"\n\n\

    ## Concept
    A Webhook (also called a web callback or HTTP push API) is a way for your application to be notified of an event in real time.

    For example, if you send a contract for signing and need to be notified as soon as it get signed.

    You could program a loop to query the document status every 5 minutes for many days until you receive a response saying the document is signed. This is a bad approach as it will waste a lot of resources everytime you make a call to the API for no reason.

    A better approach would be to configure a webhook in the eZmax's administration console to watch for a specific event. In this exemple, the event to monitor is "DocumentCompleted" from the module "Ezsign". This way, as soon as the document gets signed, a request will be made to YOUR server to let you know about the event that just happened.

    When you configure eZmax to notify you of events, you must provide your server's URL and a fallback email address. The URL provided must use HTTPS for security reasons.

    ### Types of Webhook:
    Look for purple indicators with the word "EVENT" throughout the documentation to see currently available Webhooks events you can subscribe to. If you have a need for an event that is not available, please send a feature request to technical support.

    ### Important:
    - The event will be delivered using a POST request.
    - Your server will need to reply with a HTTP Status Code 202 or 204 to let eZmax know you've accepted the message and we shall not try to deliver the message again. If the server does not respond with a 202 or 204 Code, the message will be sent over and over until all tries are exhausted.
    - The 202 or 204 response must be returned in less than 30 seconds otherwise a timeout will occur and the event will be retried following the retry schedule.
    - Make sure to secure your Webhook receiving URL to make sure someone does not send forged messages to your application. You can do this by providing a secure token in your URL, for example "?token=mysecuretoken1234", or by validating the webhook message's signature.

    ### Testing
    In eZmax's administration module, you'll find a "Test" button that you can use as many time as you need to test your server code easily with a sample event.

    ## Retries
    eZmax will attempt to deliver the event to your server instantly but will retry many times if your server does not respond successfully for some reason (see schedule below). After all attempts are exhausted, the event will be forwarded to the configured fallback email in the same format as the webhook. The email body will contain the JSON request in the same format as the webhook. This way, you'll be able to send the request to your server using <a href="https://www.postman.com/" target="_blank">Postman</a>, <a href="https://curl.se/" target="_blank">Curl</a> or similar tool.

    ### Retry Delivery schedule
    This is the approximate retry schedule. Since there is a 30 seconds timeout on each try, there could be a cumulative overhead up to 3½ minutes.

    | Minutes after previous step | Minutes after event | Method |
    | :-------------------------: | :-----------------: | ------ |
    | N/A                         | 0                   | HTTPS  |
    | 1                           | 1                   | HTTPS  |
    | 5                           | 6                   | HTTPS  |
    | 15                          | 21                  | HTTPS  |
    | 15                          | 36                  | HTTPS  |
    | 15                          | 51                  | HTTPS  |
    | 15                          | 66                  | HTTPS  |
    | 0                           | 66                  | Email  |

    ### Failed attempt reporting
    If you don't receive the event on the first attempt, there will be debugging information about each previous attempt in the body of the event. You'll be able to see the timestamp of each previous attempt and the return code returned by your server or a timeout indication if your server hasn't replied.

- description: "All notable changes to this project will be documented in this section.\n\
    \nVersion numbers are using **MAJOR**.**MINOR**.**PATCH** numbering format for\
    \ example 1.2.23\n\n**MAJOR** will be incremented only if there is an incompatible\
    \ breaking change. New distinct documentation and specification files will be\
    \ published.\n\n**MINOR** will be incremented only if a function becomes deprecated\
    \ or deleted (after being deprecated in a previous version)\n\n**PATCH** will\
    \ be incremented everytime changes and additions are released.\n\nYou can always\
    \ safely update to newer **PATCH** version if you stay in the same **MAJOR**.**MINOR**\
    \ prefix.\n\nYou can safely update to a newer **MINOR** version as long as you\
    \ don't jump more than a version at a time. For example, let say there is a function\
    \ named \"foo\" in version 1.0.23. We might deprecate this function in version\
    \ 1.1.1 but you can continue using it. We might decide to remove it in version\
    \ 1.2.1 so then you would have a breaking change if you try to update to version\
    \ 1.2.1 without having fixed the issue with your deprecated \"foo\" function.\n\
    \nFor each version, there will be the list of changes:\n* **Early Adopters** for\
    \ new features not officially considered final and ready for production use.\n\
    * **Added** for new features.\n* **Changed** for changes in existing functionality.\n\
    * **Deprecated** for soon-to-be removed features.\n* **Removed** for now removed\
    \ features.\n* **Fixed** for any bug fixes.\n* **Security** in case of vulnerabilities.\n\
